                You made an error, you have fallen off the track.
                This has produced an internal state of chaos, worry and concern.
                All now is unknown and chaotic, You have no idea what to do.

                You have now come face to face with an Invisible Monster.
                Your Fear response has hit hard.
                Contrary to what your parents said...Monsters do exist.
                We take the role of the knight and our sole purpose is to vanquish all our Monsters(FEARs) and move forward.
                This is how we grow.

                For some this process will be easy for others difficult, understand it is your own journey.
                Pain can be both subjective and objective.
                Do not compare yourself to who others are today, but rather who you were yesterday.

                Face your Fears.
                You may have to come to terms that you might have had a hand in your own downfall.
                You may have created certain conclusions/Hypothesis based on past painful experiences.
                Make peace with this.
                Imagine how far we would be able to go if we did not have to carry our fears on our backs.
                Solidify your mind, identify actions/friends/family in your life that bring you chaos.
                We do not run from this. We accept it and change our behaviour.
                We cannot control the actions of others but we can control our own actions.

                      As a beginner judging your own intensity will be hard, so your first training cycle(4-6 weeks) should be used more as a learning opportunity to enhance future training.

                      Sleep, A Great 7 - 8 hrs hopefully REM cycle kicks in. Pray to the Youtube Fitness Gods.
                      <br>
                      Healthy food intake(recovery may be better at higher food consumption and vice versa)
                      <br>
                      Deload weeks(Purposely lowering training variables for a week or 2 weeks to lower fatigue and prepare you for later training.)
                      <br>
                      Ice baths, Saunas, Massages (Not directly improve recovery but may have a PLACEBO effect.)
                      <br>
                      Special exercises(Shoulder breakers, Face pulls, Band-pull-aparts, Band work) at low intensity.
                      <br>
                      Streching(Static at times outside training, Dynamic during,before and/or after training)

                      Mental health is no joke, if you need to see a health specialist, DO IT.
                      <br>
                      Now my guide for mastery.
                      <br>
                      1 - Find a Task that can be done everyday. (Above we chose working out.) 
                      <br>
                      But what if I do not go to the gym everyday?
                      That's fine, active recovery, Streching, Mobility work, 5 mins of cardio everyday is'nt that bad. Take a walk with your Pup.
                      This provides a routine, that is fun, gives you something to do and possibly you can dive deep and learn more.
                      <br>
                      Daily Task can be anything but I suggest something to get you active.
                      <br>
                      This provides structure.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      2 - Find a Task that is scaleable. (Do not count the above.) 
                      <br>
                      Possibly something that you enjoy, can make you money and is CHALLENGING.
                      Personally I enjoy Programming (I mean Computer Programming.)
                      IMPORTANT: Assuming Task 1 above can make you money and it's your best option at the moment. BY ALL MEANS FOLLOW THAT PATH.
                      <br>
                      This provides purpose. SIMPLE
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      3 - Track Progress (Measuring GROWTH can be really exciting and satisfying).
                      <br>
                      I use both written and electronic means of recording progress.
                      The reason I believe this is so Helpful, it provides a mean to combat chaos.
                      I am an overthinker and even when I get alot done, I feel like shit, Recording my progress be it a to-do list or
                      just a graph, Spreadsheet, whatever means has brought me solace.
                      And it is really awesome seeing number go up :)
                      <br>
                      This provides solace, Tracking when you begin is AMAZING.
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      4 - Take a Break (Planned prefably)
                      <br>
                      Planned just due to the tendacy to confuse Taking a break with quiting.
                      Eg: A week deload after 12 weeks of Hard training. Great
                      <br>
                      Eg: You go to the gym once a week and state the 6 days are needed for a BREAK. No, You just a BITCH.
                      <br>
                      That been said, Planned breaks are incredible for reliving both mental and physical stress.
                      Spend time doing something else.
                      <br>
                      This provides a BREAK. duh

                      <br>
                      <br> 
                      5 - Multitasking is Cancer (Get the reference? No Ok)
                      <br>
                      Here's an article read

                      <br>
                      Now let me present my personal view.
                      <br>
                      Most people can't focus and make progress on one task.
                      How will you handle more then 1? 
                      <br>
                      This prevents you from taking on more then you can handle.
                      <br>

                      in disorder. Letting go is hard, I cannot force this on you. No one can. Move away, delete numbers, spend more time at the gym and if you really want people out of your life.

                      <br>
                      Share a fake secret, if kept great if not great,LEAVE.

                      Do they want the best for you?
                      <br>
                      Are they willing to listen to you at hard times? Just listening instead of comparing.
                      <br>
                      Do they share in your happiness? Or do they try to one up you?
                      <br>
                      Do they hold you to high standards? Are they happy when you fall of track?
                      <br>
                      This applies to both family and friends.
                      <br>
                      If you offer advice, meaningful words and they hold you in comtempt. LEAVE
                      <br>
                      Trying to save a sinking ship is very hard, you could drown as well.
                      Do not provide passive consent to being treated badly.

                      You can share bad news. And not be held in comtempt.

            <p class="lead">I agree and disagree, if you a beginner, Setting your goals too high can be overwhelming and probably cause chaos.
              <br>
              When you start be conservative and increment from there.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              I suggest you should have a short term goals(eg: Daily)
              <br>
              A medium length goal(eg: weekly and/or Monthly)
              <br>
              A long term goal (eg: 6 months -  Years)
